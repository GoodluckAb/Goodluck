# Acme AttritionForecast

Welcome to the **Acme AttritionForecast** project repository! This project focuses on analyzing employee attrition data and developing predictive models to forecast future turnover rates. By identifying key factors that influence employee attrition, we aim to provide actionable insights for improving employee retention strategies and enhancing organizational productivity.

## Project Overview

Employee attrition is a critical concern for organizations due to its impact on productivity, morale, and operational costs. This project analyzes historical employee data to uncover patterns and trends associated with attrition and uses these insights to build predictive models that anticipate future employee turnover.

### Objectives:
- Understanding key factors that drive employee attrition.
- Creating visualizations to illustrate attrition trends across departments, roles, and other demographics.
- Building predictive models to identify employees at higher risk of leaving, allowing for preemptive retention strategies.

## Dataset

The dataset contains a variety of features covering employee demographics, job roles, compensation, performance, and other attributes that contribute to a comprehensive view of employee turnover. Through data exploration and predictive modeling, this project offers insights into attrition factors and identifies at-risk employees.

## Project Structure

This repository contains the following core components:
- **Data Exploration and Visualization:** Interactive dashboards in BI tools, exploring turnover trends across different factors.
- **Descriptive Analytics:** In-depth analysis reports on attrition causes, including the influence of job satisfaction, workload, and career growth.
- **Documentation:** This README and additional files with setup, instructions, and insights from the analysis.

## Additional Information
## Visualizations: Interactive dashboards will be available in the dashboards/ directory. Use your BI tool of choice to load and visualize the provided reports.
## Documentation: All analysis reports and findings are documented in the docs/ folder. Please refer to these documents for detailed insights and methodologies used in the project.
